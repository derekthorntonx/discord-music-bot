# discord-music-bot

Simple Discord bot to stream audio from Youtube into a voice channel. Created in light of the numerous security breaches other popular Discord music-bots have experienced. Purposefully given very limited scope compared to other music-bots to limit the spread of malicious activity if compromised (no DMing phishing links, no spamming channels, no global commands, no unnecessary privileges in general).

# How to set-up
Visit Discord developer documentation and create an application

Take client_id and token from application panel, place into .env file

From Discord developer menu, invite newly created bot into server of choice via OAuth tab (must have moderater role or higher)
